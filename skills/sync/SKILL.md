name: sync
description: End-to-end refresh — compile pending raw inputs, lint+fix the wiki, run a flywheel pass across active projects, refresh the task dashboard, then surface a briefing of what changed and what needs attention. Optionally chain into a morning or evening briefing. Run anytime you want to bring Kevin's state fully current and get one consolidated update. Heavier than quick-pulse, lighter than running each skill by hand.

# Sync

One pass through every maintenance op, in dependency order, ending in a single status line the user can scan in a second. Use this when you've been away for a while, when you want to start a session fresh, or when something feels stale and you don't want to think about which skill to run.

## Arguments

Optional first arg selects a briefing to chain after sync completes:

- `morning` — run the [morning-briefing](../morning-briefing/SKILL.md) protocol after step 8.
- `evening` — run the [evening-briefing](../evening-briefing/SKILL.md) protocol after step 8.
- _(none)_ — sync only; no briefing.

The briefing reads the post-sync state, so it's strictly better than running the briefing standalone against stale data. Output gets a second block appended (see Output).

## Why this shape

Most maintenance ops have a natural order: compile feeds lint feeds the wiki state that briefings read. Running them piecemeal works but leaves you reconciling: did I compile before I lint? Did the dashboard update? `sync` runs the full chain and tells you the outcome — pass, partial, or fail — with the report paths anchored.

## Protocol

### 1. Compile pending raw inputs

Loop the standard compile protocol — exactly the steps in [knowledge-compile](../knowledge-compile/SKILL.md), inlined here for one-shot execution:

```
mcp__plugin_agent-kevin_kevin__compile_status     # see what's pending
```

If anything is pending, loop:
1. `mcp__plugin_agent-kevin_kevin__compile_next` — returns `{ itemId, kind, fileName, prompt, meta }` or `{ done: true }`.
2. If `done`, exit the loop.
3. Read the `prompt` field carefully; perform the synthesis using Read/Write/Edit per its instructions.
4. `mcp__plugin_agent-kevin_kevin__compile_write` with the `itemId`.
5. Goto 1.

If nothing is pending, skip to step 2.

Track: how many items processed, any errors.

### 2. Lint + auto-fix

```
mcp__plugin_agent-kevin_kevin__knowledge_lint with { fix: true }
```

Returns `{ status, message, errors, warnings, suggestions, fixed, reportPath }`. Auto-fix rewrites stale wikilinks and inserts missing backlinks. The remaining `errors` are real — they need human judgment.

### 3. Prune transient memory

```
mcp__plugin_agent-kevin_kevin__memory_prune
```

Deletes `memory/YYYY-MM-DD*.md` older than the retention window (14 days). Cheap, idempotent. Skip if no daily memory files exist.

### 4. Rewrite stale wikilinks (defensive)

```
mcp__plugin_agent-kevin_kevin__links_rewrite
```

Lint with `fix:true` already calls this internally — running it again is a no-op when the wiki is clean. Skip if step 2 reported zero auto-fixes.

### 5. Flywheel pass

Run the [flywheel](../flywheel/SKILL.md) protocol — cross-project work sweep. Touch each active project at least briefly, advance/update/close tasks, capture decisions. Placement is deliberate: after the wiki is clean (steps 1-4) so the flywheel reads a current memory index, but **before** dashboard + scan (steps 6-7) so those reflect the post-flywheel task state.

Quick form for one-shot execution:
1. Read `<HOME>/knowledge/memory/index.md` `## Active Threads` for current portfolio state.
2. For each active project, `mcp__plugin_agent-kevin_kevin__task_query` with `{ project, status: "active" }` and `{ project, status: "open" }`.
3. For each task: **advance** (concrete work), **update** (`task_thread` with new info, `task_update` for status/priority changes), **close** (`task_close`), or **defer** (set blocked + reason).
4. **Archive sweep — unconditional.** Move every `status: done` / `status: cancelled` task file from `projects/<slug>/tasks/` into `projects/<slug>/tasks/archive/`. This is a deterministic janitor that runs every sync, independent of whether step 3 made any mutations. Discover candidates with `grep -l '^status: \(done\|cancelled\)' projects/*/tasks/*.md`; for each match, `mkdir -p` the project's archive dir and `mv` the file in. Don't touch files already under `archive/`.
5. If cross-cutting patterns emerge across ≥2 projects, draft a `<HOME>/knowledge/concepts/<slug>.md` and add a bullet to `knowledge/index.md` `## Concepts`.
6. Log architectural decisions to `<HOME>/knowledge/memory/index.md` `## Recent Decisions`.
7. **Persist flywheel snapshot.** Call `mcp__plugin_agent-kevin_kevin__report_write` with `category: 'briefings'`, `slug: 'flywheel'`, `skill: 'flywheel'`, a one-line title, a body covering projects touched + tasks moved + concepts drafted, and `status: 'findings'` if anything moved (closes, updates, threads, concepts, decisions) or `status: 'clean'` if only the archive sweep ran. The morning brief reads these to pick up the trail across sessions.

Bound the breadth: touch every active project, don't sink the whole session into one. The archive sweep (step 4) is the one mechanical action that always runs — closing tasks throughout the week without archiving lets `Recently Closed` accumulate and clutters the active dirs. Steps 4 and 7 are unconditional; everything else fires only when there's real work to do. Skip the in-skill wrap summary — that lands in step 8 below as part of the sync output. Flywheel's orient sub-steps (dashboard refresh, TASKS.md read, task_scan) are intentionally fanned out across sync's steps 6-8 so they reflect post-flywheel state, not pre-flywheel.

### 6. Refresh task dashboard

```
mcp__plugin_agent-kevin_kevin__task_dashboard
```

Forces a rebuild of `projects/TASKS.md` from current task frontmatter (now reflecting flywheel mutations). Returns `{ active, blocked, overdue, stale, closedRecent }`.

### 7. Surface what needs attention

```
mcp__plugin_agent-kevin_kevin__task_scan
```

Returns `{ unblocked, autoBlocked, autoClosed, overdue, stale, priorityBumps, pendingIds }`. The auto-* buckets were already applied; the surfaces (`overdue`, `stale`, `priorityBumps`) are the human-judgment queue.

### 8. Read the dust-settled state

After all mutations above, both `projects/TASKS.md` and the lint report at `.kevin/lint.md` are current. Read them once each — these are your sources for the summary, not the per-tool return values:

```
Read <HOME>/projects/TASKS.md
Read <HOME>/.kevin/lint.md
Read <HOME>/knowledge/memory/index.md   # for narrative context
```

### 9. Briefing (only if arg supplied)

If invoked with `morning` or `evening`, inline the matching briefing protocol now:

- `morning` → run [morning-briefing](../morning-briefing/SKILL.md) verbatim. The Active Threads / task queries / scan results are already in context from step 8; skip the re-reads and go straight to the signal-news perplexity call, compose, **then call `report_write` per the briefing skill's `## Persist` section**. Compose-without-persist is the bug — the briefing isn't done until `reports/index.md` shows today's entry.
- `evening` → run [evening-briefing](../evening-briefing/SKILL.md) verbatim. Same context-reuse — pull today's git log + closed-today tasks, compose, **then call `report_write` per the briefing skill's `## Persist` section**. Same rule: not done until persisted.

If no arg, skip this step.

## Output

One block, tight. Skip empty sections — don't pad.

```

If everything is clean: a one-liner is the right output.

```
✅ Sync complete — wiki healthy, <N> active tasks, nothing flagged.
```

If a briefing arg was supplied, append the briefing block below the sync block (or below the one-liner). Two blocks, one message — sync on top, briefing underneath. Don't merge them; the shapes are distinct on purpose.

## Boundaries

- **Don't synthesize the compile prompt's content here.** Step 1 follows the compile loop verbatim — the `prompt` field tells you what to do for each item; don't improvise.
- **Don't auto-close tasks based on lint output.** Lint reports orphan articles, not task health.
- **Don't open new tasks from this skill.** Surface "needs attention" items in the summary; let the user choose what to file.
- **One pass only.** If a step fails 3 times, surface the error and stop. Don't loop indefinitely.

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ Running this every session reflexively. Use `quick-pulse` if you just want a status check.
- ❌ Hiding lint errors because they're "not blocking." If lint flagged 3 errors, list all 3.
- ❌ Skipping the dust-settled re-read. Per-tool return values are useful for tracing, but the rendered files are the source of truth for the summary.
- ❌ Writing prose paragraphs in the output. The block format above is the contract.
