description: Rebuild and open the Agent OS dashboard — a static HTML mission-control page covering today's plan and activity, work across projects, sessions, Kevin's brain, reports, capabilities, and system internals. Also refreshes the projects/TASKS.md task dashboard in the same pass. Use when the user wants the big picture of what Kevin is and what's going on.

# Dashboard

The Agent OS dashboard is the command center: a self-contained `index.html` at
the agent home, regenerated from current state on demand. No server, zero
external requests.

## Run

1. Rebuild the snapshot (one call refreshes both `index.html` and
   `projects/TASKS.md` — the two derived views always regenerate together):

```
mcp__plugin_agent-kevin_kevin__dashboard
```

Returns `{ path, bytes, tasks }`.

2. Open it for the user (macOS):

```bash
open "<path from step 1>"
```

   If `open` errors (sandboxed or restricted setups block app launches), skip
   this step entirely — do NOT retry with `open -a`, specific browsers, or any
   other launcher. Just include the `file://` path in your reply so the user
   can open it themselves.

3. Reply with one line: the dashboard is rebuilt (and open, if the launch
   worked), plus anything the health badge would flag (the tool result alone
   doesn't carry health — skip unless asked).

## Pages

`today` (plan / goals / today-so-far / news) · `tasks` (agenda / needs
attention) · `projects` · `sessions` · `brain` (threads / memory / concepts /
pipeline / lint) · `reports` · `capabilities` (cheatsheet / skills / tools /
commands / reflexes) · `persona` · `system` (context / settings / logs) ·
`profile` (reached via the operator card) · `status` (reached via the health
badge). Sub-tabs deep-link: `index.html#tasks/attention`.

## Notes

- Pure read: regenerating the dashboard never mutates knowledge or task files
  (`projects/TASKS.md` is a derived view, rebuilt from frontmatter).
- Secrets are redacted at the source (`••••`); never un-redact them.
- Markdown links open via the configured opener app: set the `MARKDOWN_URL`
  env var in `.claude/settings.local.json` (`{path}` placeholder, e.g.
  `markedit://open?path={path}`); defaults to
  `obsidian://open?path={path}&paneType=tab` (new Obsidian tab, dashboard stays put).
- Every `/agent-kevin:sync` also refreshes the dashboard; `kevin dashboard`
  does the same from a terminal.
