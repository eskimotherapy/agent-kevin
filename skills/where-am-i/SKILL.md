name: where-am-i
description: Show the Claude Code sessions from the last 24 hours scoped to the folder Kevin runs from (the HOME and everything beneath it), with a substantive summary of what each was about, where it left off, and the resume command. Use whenever the operator asks "where am I", "what sessions are running", "what was I working on", "which sessions are open", "I'm lost / overwhelmed", "what did I leave off on", or wants to find/resume a recent session. Also useful at the start of a day or after a break to re-orient. Accepts an optional hours window (e.g. "/agent-kevin:where-am-i 48") and "all" to include every project on the machine. Also runs in triage mode — `/agent-kevin:where-am-i triage [scope]` or when the operator asks "what should I tend to / work on next / which session needs me" — ranking the sessions by urgency and importance, interviewing via AskUserQuestion, and handing back the resume command for the chosen one. And in checkpoint mode — `/agent-kevin:where-am-i checkpoint` or when the operator asks to "checkpoint this session / save where we are / write a handoff" — writing a short pickup note for THIS session (incremental since the last checkpoint) as a chat reply, so the SessionEnd capture files it into knowledge.

# where-am-i — session radar

Re-orient the operator across their simultaneous Claude Code sessions. The deterministic
work (scanning `~/.claude/projects/`) lives in a bundled script; your job is the
synthesis: a per-session narrative good enough that the operator knows in one read
which thread is which and where it stands.

Three modes, all about session continuity:

| Mode | Subject | Output |
|---|---|---|
| default | every session in scope | digest + saved report |
| `triage` | every session in scope | ranked interview, ephemeral |
| `checkpoint` | **this session only** | a pickup note as chat, captured on exit |

## Step 1 — gather

```bash
SCOPE="$PWD"
[ -n "$KEVIN_HOME" ] && SCOPE="$SCOPE,$KEVIN_HOME"
[ -n "${KEVIN_CODE_PATH:-$AGENT_CODE_PATH}" ] && SCOPE="$SCOPE,$(dirname "${KEVIN_CODE_PATH:-$AGENT_CODE_PATH}")"
bun "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/list_sessions.ts" --hours 24 --scope "$SCOPE"
```

- Default window is 24 hours; if the user gave a number (e.g. `/agent-kevin:where-am-i 48`),
  pass it as `--hours`.
- **Scope:** `--scope` takes comma-separated roots; a session counts when launched in any
  root or beneath it. The default above covers the current folder, the agent HOME, and the
  code tree (the parent of `${KEVIN_CODE_PATH:-$AGENT_CODE_PATH}` — repos and their sibling worktrees), so the
  radar sees HOME sessions and code-repo sessions even though they live in separate trees.
  Duplicate roots are fine (the script dedupes); other agents' homes stay out of scope. If
  the user says "all" / "everywhere" / asks about other projects, pass `--scope all`.
- Output is JSON, newest first. Each session has: `session_id`, `title` (the operator's
  `/rename` name when set, else Claude Code's first-prompt auto-title), `cwd`,
  `git_branch`, `first_user_msg`, `recent_user_msgs` (last 3),
  `last_assistant_text` (long excerpt of the final reply), `minutes_ago`, `file`.

## Step 2 — write the summaries

The summary is the whole point of this skill, and it must be substantive — a short
paragraph (roughly 3–5 sentences), not a fragment. A one-liner forces the operator to
resume the session just to find out what it was; that defeats the purpose. Cover:

1. **What the session is about** — the original ask (`first_user_msg`), in plain words.
2. **What happened** — the key findings or work done along the way.
3. **Where it stands now** — the last exchange (`recent_user_msgs` + `last_assistant_text`):
   was something shipped, was a conclusion reached, is there an unanswered question?
4. **What's open** — the natural next step if the operator resumes, when one exists.

If the JSON snippets don't support that (thin snippets, image-only last messages),
read the transcript tail before writing — `tail -c 80000 <file>` and skim the last few
assistant messages. Don't guess and don't pad; a summary that "makes no sense" is worse
than reading another 80KB.

## Step 3 — render the digest

Lead with a one-line **through-line** (a `>` blockquote): the single sentence that ties
today's sessions together. Then a compact **index table** — the scan layer: one row per
session, state emoji first. Then the buckets carry the substance. No dated `# Where Am I`
header — the through-line carries the open, and surfaces stamp the time themselves.

|   | # | Session | Last |
|---|---|---------|------|
| ❓ | 1 | Weekly goals interview redesign | *7m* · asked which scope to grill on |
| ✅ | 2 | Session capture cursor fix | *3h* · shipped, tests green |
| 🚧 | 3 | Blog draft exploration | *9h* · mid-draft, parked |

## 🟢 In motion (last hour)

**1. Weekly goals interview redesign** · *7m ago*

Started from the ask to make the weekly and monthly goals skills consider the full task
board and recent sessions, then interview you instead of generating generic goals. The
session widened both skills' inputs to pull every task across all statuses and priorities
and added the grilling-interview behavior, all in the plugin source. The last reply
reported both skills upgraded, so this is at a clean stopping point unless you want to
test-drive the new flow.

## 🕐 Earlier today

...same card shape...

---
*6 sessions · 24h window · scoped to ~/Documents/Agents/Kevin*
```

Formatting rules:

- **Through-line first.** One `>` blockquote sentence synthesising the set, above the
  first bucket. It's what the operator reads if they read nothing else.
- **Index table second** — one row per session, same order and numbering as the cards.
  Columns: state emoji (❓ the last reply asks the operator something · ✅ clean stop,
  work delivered · 🚧 mid-flight or stalled without a question), number, title, then
  `*age*` + a ≤6-word fragment of where it left off. Keep cells short — the substance
  lives in the cards, the table is the map. Skip the table when there are ≤2 sessions.
- **Card = `**N. Title** · *time ago*` on one line, then a blank line, then the summary
  paragraph, then a blank line, then the resume line.** The blank lines matter — they
  render as separate blocks (title, summary, resume) instead of one run-on paragraph.
  Nothing else — no directory, no branch, no turn counts, no truncated session id (the
  full id is already in the resume command). Mention a branch or sub-project inside the
  summary prose only when it's load-bearing for telling sessions apart.
- **Buckets:** 🟢 `minutes_ago <= 60` = "In motion", 🕐 otherwise = "Earlier today".
  If the window was widened past 24h, add a 📦 "Older" bucket per extra day.
- **Recognize yourself.** One session is the current conversation (its snippets describe
  what's happening right now). Tag its title `← this session`, skip its summary and
  resume line.
- **Resume line:** just `claude --resume <full-session-id>` — no `cd` prefix.
- **Order within buckets:** most recent first (the JSON is already sorted).
- **Footer:** total count, window, and scope (e.g. `scoped to ~/Documents/Agents/Kevin`
  or `all projects`).
- This is read-only with respect to sessions. Never resume, kill, or modify a session
  yourself.

## Step 4 — persist the digest

The radar is good history: a dated record of which threads were live and where each
stood. After rendering, save it via the
`mcp__plugin_agent-kevin_kevin__report_write` MCP tool — the helper writes the file
and inserts a one-line entry into `<HOME>/reports/index.md` under today's date, and the
SessionStart hook surfaces that entry in the next session's context.

```
report_write({
  category: 'radar',
  slug: 'where-am-i',
  title: <e.g. 'Where am I — 6 sessions across 24h'>,
  skill: 'where-am-i',
  body: <the full digest, no frontmatter — exactly what was shown in chat>,
  status: <'findings' if any session left work open, else 'clean'>
});
```

Surface `📄 Saved to <path>` (the absolute `path` the tool returns, not `relPath` — so it's command-clickable in any terminal) at the end of the digest. Skip the report only when the
scan returns zero sessions (nothing worth recording).

## Triage mode — `/where-am-i triage [scope]`

When the arguments contain `triage` (any case), or the operator asks "what should I tend
to / work on next / which session needs me", the question changes from *where am I* to
*where should I go*. Steps 1–2 run as normal; steps 3–4 are replaced by a ranked
interview. Everything comes from the session JSON already gathered — no other data
source. Triage is ephemeral — **no report**.

**Scope filter.** A remaining argument (e.g. `/where-am-i triage acme`) keeps only
sessions whose `cwd` contains it, case-insensitively. No matches → say so and triage
the full set rather than returning empty-handed.

**Rank.** Order candidates by what most needs the operator, blending:

1. **Decision-pending** — `last_assistant_text` ends by asking the operator something
   ("Want me to…?", numbered options, an explicit question). The agent is stalled on a
   human call; oldest first.
2. **Importance** — weigh against the memory already in context: hard deadlines, P0/P1
   tasks, day-job precedence. A session tied to a dated obligation outranks a code
   review that can wait.
3. **Momentum** — a session that just finished (agent reported done) needs a look
   before its context goes cold; long-idle exploratory threads rank last.

Batch duplicates: several sessions on one work-stream (same branch or topic) are ONE
candidate — name the lead session and note the others in its description.

**Interview.** First render the ranked candidates as a table so the operator sees the
whole field before choosing — short cells, reasoning stays in the interview:

```
## 🩺 Triage · 3 of 11 need you

| # | Session | Why now | Tending |
|---|---------|---------|---------|
| 1 | ❓ MDEC application response | replies drafted, due Aug 14 | review & approve |
| 2 | ❓ Payments query grammar PR | asked which option 46m ago | answer its question |
| 3 | ✅ Radar feature | done, context going cold | skim & close out |
```

Then present the same top 3–4 via AskUserQuestion: label = short session name,
description = *why now* (one sentence: what it's waiting on, any deadline) + *what
tending means* (answer its question / review and approve / kick a stall / close it out).

**Deliver.** On selection, give the `claude --resume <full-session-id>` command and a
one-line brief of what to do on arrival (the specific question to answer or thing to
review). Never send input to the chosen session yourself — triage delivers the operator
to the work, it doesn't do the work.

## Checkpoint mode — `/where-am-i checkpoint`

When the arguments contain `checkpoint` (any case), or the operator asks to "checkpoint
this session / save where we are / write a handoff", the subject flips from *other*
sessions to **this** one. The script never runs — you already have the context the
script would be trying to infer from a transcript.

**Scope: the current session only.** Never checkpoint another session. A transcript read
from outside can only guess at what was verified versus assumed; the live session knows.
If the operator names another session id, tell them to run the command inside it.

**Incremental by construction.** Look back through this conversation for the most recent
checkpoint you wrote. Cover only what happened *since* it — earlier ground is already
recorded and re-summarising it buries the new material. No prior checkpoint means cover
the whole session. This needs no state file: the previous checkpoint is in the context
you're already reading.

**Write it as your reply — never to a file.** The `SessionEnd` capture picks up assistant
turns, so a checkpoint written as chat lands in `knowledge/raw/sessions/` on exit and
compiles into knowledge from there. Writing a file instead is both redundant and often
impossible: sessions launched in a code repo can't write to the agent home (outside cwd),
and the plugin isn't loaded there at all.

**Shape** — under ~10 lines, no preamble:

- **Thread** — what this session is working on, one sentence
- **State** — what's done; committed/pushed vs uncommitted; **verified vs assumed**
- **Next** — the concrete next action for someone picking this up cold
- **Watch** — what would bite them: a decision made, a trap found, a blocked dependency

**Refer to things by task id, repo name, and branch — never absolute paths.** Paths go
stale (layouts move, worktrees get pruned); a task id and a branch name don't.

**Task thread.** When the work maps to a task and the task tools are available, also
append the checkpoint to that task's thread via `task_thread` — that's the durable home
for task-linked work. Skip when the thread already says it: a checkpoint that restates
the last entry is noise in the one place that should stay signal.

**Availability.** Plugin skills only exist where the plugin is enabled — the agent home,
not code repos. In a repo session, paste the four bullets above as a prompt instead.
