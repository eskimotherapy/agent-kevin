description: Guided first-run onboarding for the agent-kevin plugin. Walks through Kevin's character (SOUL), role (IDENTITY), your basics (name, timezone), an optional web pull from your blog/site/LinkedIn/etc., and communication style — then scaffolds CLAUDE.md (operating manual + @-imports), SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, USER.md, .claude/settings.json, and seeds four system-architecture concept articles into knowledge/concepts/. If a CLAUDE.md already exists at the home directory, Kevin's version is written to CLAUDE.local.md instead. Skill packs are configured inline at the end or via /agent-kevin:configure-skills any time later. Invoke once after installing the plugin.

# Initialize Kevin

Guided onboarding. Follow the steps in order — each step's answers become defaults for later ones.

---

## Step 0 — Resolve HOME and check idempotency

Kevin's home is **the current working directory** — whatever directory the user launched `claude` from. No home-picker prompt. Power users can override by setting `KEVIN_HOME` in their shell rc.

```bash
HOME_DIR="${KEVIN_HOME:-$PWD}"
if [ -f "$HOME_DIR/SOUL.md" ]; then
  echo "ALREADY_INITIALIZED at $HOME_DIR"
fi
```

`SOUL.md` is Kevin's idempotency marker — its filename is unique to the plugin (unlike `CLAUDE.md`, which may pre-exist in any Claude Code project the plugin gets installed into).

**Detect the operating system.** Several later steps scaffold OS-specific content — the timezone probe (Step 4), the external-storage suggestion (Step 5c), the security deny-list (Step 7), and the `{{PLATFORM}}` line recorded in CLAUDE.md. Resolve it once here. Claude Code's Bash tool runs under Git Bash on Windows, so `uname` is available everywhere.

```bash
case "$(uname -s)" in
  Darwin)               KEVIN_OS="macos";   PLATFORM_LABEL="macOS" ;;
  MINGW*|MSYS*|CYGWIN*) KEVIN_OS="windows"; PLATFORM_LABEL="Windows" ;;
  Linux)
    if grep -qiE "microsoft|wsl" /proc/version 2>/dev/null; then
      KEVIN_OS="wsl";   PLATFORM_LABEL="Windows (WSL2)"
    else
      KEVIN_OS="linux"; PLATFORM_LABEL="Linux"
    fi ;;
  *)                    KEVIN_OS="unknown"; PLATFORM_LABEL="$(uname -s)" ;;
esac
echo "KEVIN_OS=$KEVIN_OS"
```

Carry `$KEVIN_OS` and `$PLATFORM_LABEL` through the rest of the walk.

**Check prerequisites — bail early if a show-stopper is missing.** Kevin's MCP server, all three hooks, and the CLI launch via `bun`, so it's a hard requirement; `git` backs the version-controlled knowledge tree, the session git-activity context, and worktrees. `python3` is **optional but recommended** — Kevin is TypeScript-first, but some tooling and integrations still reach for Python, so having it on PATH avoids friction later. On **native Windows**, Kevin runs through **Git Bash** (the shell Claude Code uses for its Bash tool) — that's the supported Windows path and supplies the POSIX environment Kevin's commands assume; **WSL2** also works if you prefer a full Linux userland.

```bash
MISSING=()
command -v bun >/dev/null 2>&1 || MISSING+=("bun  — runs Kevin's MCP server, hooks, and CLI · https://bun.sh")
command -v git >/dev/null 2>&1 || MISSING+=("git  — version-controls your knowledge tree, powers worktrees · https://git-scm.com")
command -v python3 >/dev/null 2>&1 || echo "NOTE: python3 not found (optional but recommended — occasionally needed for tooling/interop even though Kevin is TypeScript-first)."
printf 'MISSING: %s\n' "${MISSING[@]}"
```

Act on the result **before** anything else:

- **Native Windows (`$KEVIN_OS` = `windows`)** — supported; do **not** stop. Surface a one-line FYI and continue: *"Running on native Windows via Git Bash — the supported Windows path. (Prefer a full Linux userland? WSL2 works too.)"* The OS-specific steps below (timezone probe, external-storage suggestion, security deny-list, the `{{PLATFORM}}` label) already branch on `windows`, so the scaffold is shaped correctly. Heads-up worth surfacing once: a few pack-gated skills assume tools Git Bash lacks (e.g. `jq`), and the OS sandbox is unavailable on Windows — neither blocks the core setup.

- **`MISSING` non-empty** — print the block below verbatim (one line per missing tool) and **STOP**:

  > 🛑 **Missing prerequisites.** Kevin can't run until these are installed:
  >
  > `<each MISSING line>`
  >
  > Install them, then re-run `/agent-kevin:init` — it's idempotent and picks up where you left off.

- **Nothing missing** — surface the optional `NOTE` (if any) as a one-line FYI and continue.

If `ALREADY_INITIALIZED`, `AskUserQuestion` with an explicit enumeration of what re-run does. Surface the full write list so the operator knows what they're agreeing to — Step 0's prior wording understated the destructive surface and operators reasonably trusted it.

> You've already initialized at `<HOME_DIR>`. Re-running will:
>
> ✏️  Overwrite SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, USER.md, CLAUDE.md / CLAUDE.local.md (operator re-supplies tone/role/name)
> ✓  Preserve `knowledge/memory/index.md` if it has content (compile output safe — Active Threads, Recent Decisions, Learnings)
> ✓  Preserve `knowledge/index.md` if it has content (operator-curated catalog bullets safe)
> ✓  Preserve `knowledge/user/<facet>.md` files that have content (operator-curated facets safe; conflict prompt if Step 5 also synthesises content)
> ✓  Preserve `knowledge/concepts/*.md` (seeded concepts re-materialise only if missing; existing files — including 0-byte tombstones — are never overwritten)
> ✓  Preserve `knowledge/raw/`, `projects/<slug>/` (never touched)
> ⚠️  Reset `projects/TASKS.md` (auto-rebuilds on next task mutation via the `dashboard` tool)
>
> - Abort (recommended)
> - Re-run setup

Default: abort. The preservation guards below in Step 7 are what make these claims true — they must match this prompt verbatim.

---

## Step 1 — Banner + intro

Print the welcome banner inside a fenced code block (the fence preserves the ASCII art literally):

````
```
 ╔═╗ ╔═╗ ╔═╗ ╔╗╔ ╔╦╗
 ╠═╣ ║ ╦ ║╣  ║║║  ║ 
 ╩ ╩ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╝╚╝  ╩ 
===KEVIN=== 🍌
```
````

Then below the banner, plain prose (no leading whitespace, no numbered lists — the question-mark glyph signals "step Kevin will ask you about"):

> Welcome. Kevin will set up here: `<HOME_DIR>`.
>
> This onboarding takes about 5 minutes and walks through seven steps:
>
> ❓ Kevin's character, accept or refine
> ❓ Kevin's role, accept or refine
> ❓ Your basics: name, timezone
> ❓ Optional: paste any URLs about you (blog, LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.)
> ❓ Optional: paste a path or URL for your avatar (gets linked into knowledge/user/profile.md)
> ❓ Optional: should knowledge/ and projects/ live somewhere outside the home directory?
> ❓ Communication style and values
> ❓ Signal topics to track in your briefings (Kevin proposes a starter set)
> ❓ Optional: configure skill packs (SEO, Browser, third-party libraries)
> ❓ Confirm + scaffold
>
> A few of the steps will prompt Claude Code for permission to run Bash commands, write files, or fetch URLs.

---

## Step 2 — Kevin's SOUL (character)

Read the bundled template:

```bash
cat "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/SOUL.md"
```

Summarize in one sentence: *"Default: Sharp, direct, opinionated. Concise. Calls things out when wrong. Doesn't over-apologize."* Then `AskUserQuestion`:

> **Kevin's character** — accept the default or refine?
> - Accept (recommended)
> - Refine — describe what's different (e.g., "warmer and more encouraging", "even sharper and less polite")

If **Accept**: stage the template verbatim for writing in Step 7.
If **Refine**: take the redirect, edit the staged SOUL content (light touch — tone language in `## Vibe` and `## Core Truths`, keep structure intact).

---

## Step 3 — Kevin's IDENTITY (role)

Read the bundled template:

```bash
cat "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/IDENTITY.md"
```

Summarize: *"Default: AI assistant for learning, planning, research, coding."* Then `AskUserQuestion`:

> **Kevin's primary role for you** (pick one)
> - General-purpose personal assistant (recommended)
> - Coding + technical work focus
> - Research + writing focus
> - Life-management + planning focus
> - Custom — describe in one sentence

Adjust the staged IDENTITY's `## Core Role` to match. Leave `## Operational Pattern` empty (Kevin grows it over time).

---

## Step 4 — Your basics (name + timezone)

Infer defaults first:

```bash
NAME_DEFAULT=$(git config user.name 2>/dev/null || echo "${USER:-friend}")
# Timezone probe is OS-specific. macOS/Linux/WSL symlink /etc/localtime into the
# zoneinfo db, so the IANA name falls right out. Windows has no IANA tz database
# (tzutil returns Windows-style names), so skip the probe and let the user type one.
case "$KEVIN_OS" in
  macos|linux|wsl) TZ_IANA=$(readlink /etc/localtime 2>/dev/null | sed 's|.*/zoneinfo/||') ;;
  *)               TZ_IANA="" ;;
esac
```

`AskUserQuestion` (batched):

> 1. **Your name** — what should Kevin call you? (Default: `<NAME_DEFAULT>`)
> 2. **Your timezone** — IANA name like `America/New_York`. (System looks like: `<TZ_IANA>`)

When `TZ_IANA` is blank (Windows, or the probe found nothing), drop the "System looks like" hint and prompt for the IANA name outright with an example, e.g. *"IANA name like `Asia/Kuala_Lumpur` — couldn't auto-detect, so please type yours."*

Stage answers for the USER.md write.

---

## Step 4b — Where your code lives (optional)

If you use Kevin for coding or technical work, capturing your **primary codebase** path lets Kevin ground code-related tasks against it (bug fixes, reviews, tracing behavior) and surface its recent git activity in every session's context. Skip freely if Kevin is purely for writing, research, or planning — Kevin works fine with no codebase set.

Best-effort inference — only suggest a default when it's unambiguous (exactly one git repo across the common dev roots), since a generic agent can't know which of many repos is "primary":

```bash
CODE_DEFAULT=""
HITS=()
for root in "$HOME/Developer" "$HOME/Code" "$HOME/code" "$HOME/Projects" "$HOME/projects" "$HOME/src" "$HOME/source" "$HOME/repos" "$HOME/git"; do
  [ -d "$root" ] || continue
  for dir in "$root"/*/; do
    [ -d "${dir}.git" ] && HITS+=("$(cd "$dir" && pwd)")
  done
done
[ "${#HITS[@]}" -eq 1 ] && CODE_DEFAULT="${HITS[0]}"
```

Plain chat (NOT `AskUserQuestion` — the answer is a freeform absolute path):

> **Absolute path to your primary codebase?** Optional — reply `skip` if Kevin isn't for coding, or set it later in `<HOME>/.claude/settings.local.json` under `env.KEVIN_CODE_PATH`. Inferred default: `<CODE_DEFAULT>` (blank if nothing obvious found).

Parse the user's next message:

- `skip` (case-insensitive) → stage `KEVIN_CODE_PATH=""` and continue.
- Otherwise → verify the path exists (`test -d "$ANSWER"`). If it doesn't, warn and re-ask once.

Stage the resolved absolute path for two writes in Step 7:

1. USER.md → "Where Things Live → Primary codebase" entry.
2. `.claude/settings.local.json` → `env.KEVIN_CODE_PATH`, with `env.KEVIN_GIT_REPOS` derived to the same path so the codebase's recent git activity shows up in session context from day one.

---

## Step 5 — Optional: paste any URLs about yourself

Freeform multi-URL input. **Do NOT use `AskUserQuestion` here** — its `Other` text field has a fixed placeholder ("Type something") and adding a redundant "Provide URLs" option just to point at it produces a confusing UI. Ask in plain chat instead.

Emit this as a regular assistant message and wait for the user's next turn:

> **Optional — paste any URLs about you** (newline- or space-separated). Examples: personal site/blog, LinkedIn, GitHub, X/Mastodon, podcast page, talks. Kevin fetches each, synthesises durable facts into `knowledge/user/*.md`, and cites the source URL inline.
>
> Reply with the URLs, or say `skip` to continue with empty stubs.

Parse the user's next message: split on whitespace + newlines, keep tokens that look like URLs (start with `http://`, `https://`, or a bare domain like `github.com/...`). If the message is `skip` (case-insensitive) or contains no URLs, jump to Step 6.

If blank → skip to Step 6.

Otherwise, parse URLs (split on whitespace + newlines, filter to anything that looks like a URL). For each, `WebFetch` and synthesise into staged content:

- Bio / about / personal site → `profile.md` (bio, location, work focus) + `interests.md` (topics they write about) + light tone hints → `preferences.md`
- Professional / LinkedIn-style → `career.md` (roles, companies, dates) + `skills.md`
- Code host (GitHub, GitLab, etc.) → augment `skills.md` (languages, repos) + `interests.md` (project themes)
- Social / posts → light tone signal only into `preferences.md`. No post-content extraction.

Sort URLs by their inferred type — Kevin decides which facet each lands in based on content, not the order the user pasted them.

**Rules:**
- Frontmatter: `title`, `sources` (URL list), `created`, `updated` (today)
- Cite inline: `_Source: <URL>_` at end of each fact
- Durable facts only — no transient news items, current events, etc.
- 404 / paywall / fetch error: note it in the log, skip that URL, continue with the rest

**Do not** ask the user to confirm the synthesised content. Stage it and continue — the user can edit any `knowledge/user/*.md` file later, or re-run `/agent-kevin:knowledge-compile` to regenerate.

---

## Step 5b — Optional: your avatar

Plain chat (NOT `AskUserQuestion`, since the answer is freeform):

> **Optional — paste a path or URL for your avatar.** If you give a local path, Kevin copies it to `<HOME>/knowledge/user/assets/avatar.<ext>`. If you give a URL, Kevin downloads it the same place. Either way, Kevin adds an `Avatar:` field to your staged `knowledge/user/profile.md` pointing at the local copy so it shows up in Obsidian. Reply with the path/URL or `skip`.

Parse the next user message:
- `skip` (case-insensitive) → no-op, jump to Step 5c.
- Looks like a local file path → `cp` to `<HOME>/knowledge/user/assets/avatar.<ext>` (`mkdir -p` first; preserve original extension).
- Looks like an HTTP(S) URL → `curl -fsSL` to the same destination, infer extension from response Content-Type or URL suffix.

Stage `Avatar: knowledge/user/assets/avatar.<ext>` into the eventual `knowledge/user/profile.md` frontmatter or top-of-body. Don't fail the whole init if the download/copy fails — log it and continue with no avatar.

---

## Step 5c — Optional: external storage for knowledge/ and projects/

`AskUserQuestion`:

> **Where should `knowledge/` and `projects/` live?** Default keeps them inside your agent home. Override if you want to:
> - sync via a cloud-synced folder (`<CLOUD_EXAMPLE>` — a path outside the home)
> - keep them in a separate git repo
> - share `projects/` across multiple Kevin homes

Fill `<CLOUD_EXAMPLE>` from `$KEVIN_OS`: iCloud Drive on `macos`, OneDrive (`~/OneDrive`) on `windows`, OneDrive (via `/mnt/c/Users/<you>/OneDrive`) on `wsl`, Dropbox or Nextcloud on `linux`. Don't suggest iCloud on a Windows/WSL/Linux home.
>
> - Default: inside `<HOME>` (recommended)
> - Specify custom paths

If the user picks "Specify", ask for two paths (plain chat or two follow-up `AskUserQuestion` rounds): `KEVIN_KNOWLEDGE` and `KEVIN_PROJECTS`. Tilde-expand. Validate the paths look reasonable. Stage both env-var values for the eventual `.zshrc` reminder in Step 9.

**If either path is OUTSIDE the agent home directory**, Step 7's `.claude/settings.json` write must also append `permissions.allow` entries (and `sandbox.filesystem.allowWrite` if the user's sandbox is enabled, see below) so Claude Code can read/write there without prompting on every operation. Specifically add to `permissions.allow`:

```json
"Read(<KEVIN_KNOWLEDGE>/**)",
"Write(<KEVIN_KNOWLEDGE>/**)",
"Edit(<KEVIN_KNOWLEDGE>/**)",
"Read(<KEVIN_PROJECTS>/**)",
"Write(<KEVIN_PROJECTS>/**)",
"Edit(<KEVIN_PROJECTS>/**)"
```

And if `~/.claude/settings.json` has a `sandbox.filesystem.allowWrite` array, mirror those two paths into it too — otherwise Claude Code's sandbox blocks the writes regardless of `permissions.allow`.

If both paths are inside `<HOME>`, no extra grants needed (the home dir's `.` is already on the writable list).

---

## Step 6 — Communication style + values

If Step 5 surfaced a tone signal, use it as a default. Otherwise no default.

`AskUserQuestion`:

> **How do you want Kevin to talk to you?**
> - Direct + technical
> - Step-by-step walkthrough
> - Encouraging + simple
> - Custom — describe in one sentence

Stage for the `## How to Talk to Me` section of USER.md.

Optionally `AskUserQuestion`:

> **Any hard preferences / values I should always respect?** (Optional — answer N/A to skip)
> Examples: "no recommending alcohol", "always halal options", "I work in healthcare — never specific medical actions"

Stage for the `## Hard Rules` section.

---

## Step 6b — Signal topics

These drive the news in your briefings: the `morning-briefing` skill reads `knowledge/user/profile.md` → `## Signal Topics` and runs a web search per topic, so the brief surfaces articles about your interests, projects, industry, and the things you care about, not generic headlines. The whole point is to **recommend** a starter set, not interrogate the user, so do the work first.

**Propose a derived starter list before asking.** Synthesise 5–8 topics from everything you already learned this session:
- The **role** picked in Step 3 (e.g. coding focus → the languages/frameworks/tooling ecosystem; research focus → their fields).
- Facts synthesised from the **URLs** in Step 5 — their industry, stack, employer/domain, side projects, the things they write about.
- Their **locale** (from the Step 4 timezone) — a local tech/business/regulatory cluster where it's relevant.
- Sensible generics for an AI-assistant user: the **AI / model ecosystem** they build on, and a broad tech cluster.

Plain chat (NOT `AskUserQuestion` — this is an open-ended list, and the recommend-then-refine flow matches Steps 5/5b/5c). Emit the proposal as a bullet list and wait for the user's next turn:

> **Signal topics for your briefings.** These are the subjects Kevin tracks with web search each morning so your briefing carries news that's actually relevant to you. Based on what you've told me, here's a starter set:
>
> - `<topic 1>`
> - `<topic 2>`
> - … (5–8, each a short phrase, optionally with a parenthetical of sub-terms)
>
> Reply with edits — drop any, add your own (industries, competitors, technologies, regions, causes) — or say `looks good` to take them as-is. Say `skip` for a minimal default.

Parse the next message: if `looks good` → keep the proposal; if edits/additions → apply them; if `skip` → stage a minimal generic default (`AI engineering & the model ecosystem`, `general technology news`). Stage the final list for the `## Signal Topics` section of `knowledge/user/profile.md` in Step 7.

---

## Step 7 — Write the scaffold

Create the directory tree:

```bash
# Resolve knowledge + projects paths from Step 5c. Default = under $HOME_DIR.
KNOWLEDGE_ROOT="${KEVIN_KNOWLEDGE:-$HOME_DIR/knowledge}"
PROJECTS_ROOT="${KEVIN_PROJECTS:-$HOME_DIR/projects}"

mkdir -p "$HOME_DIR"/.kevin/{config,logs} "$HOME_DIR"/.claude/assets
mkdir -p "$KNOWLEDGE_ROOT"/{user/assets,concepts,memory,raw/{sessions,user,inbox,archive/inbox}}
mkdir -p "$PROJECTS_ROOT"
```

**Record the template baseline.** Write `$HOME_DIR/.kevin/version.json` stamping the plugin version this home was scaffolded from. This is the anchor the SessionStart banner + dashboard use to detect pending HOME migrations, and the "from" point `/agent-kevin:upgrade` reconciles from. A fresh home equals the installed version, so it starts `current` (never falsely flagged). **Skip the write if the file already exists** (a re-init must not reset an upgrade-tracked baseline).

```bash
VERSION_FILE="$HOME_DIR/.kevin/version.json"
if [ ! -f "$VERSION_FILE" ]; then
  PLUGIN_VERSION=$(grep -o '"version"[[:space:]]*:[[:space:]]*"[^"]*"' "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/.claude-plugin/plugin.json" | head -1 | sed 's/.*"\([^"]*\)"$/\1/')
  TODAY=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
  printf '{\n  "templateVersion": "%s",\n  "initializedAt": "%s",\n  "history": []\n}\n' "$PLUGIN_VERSION" "$TODAY" > "$VERSION_FILE"
fi
```

Note: do **not** create `.claude/skills/` here. Third-party skill libraries are installed via `/agent-kevin:configure-skills` after the user relaunches.

Copy Kevin's avatar into `.claude/assets/` so it stays out of the way at the home root but is still resolvable from `IDENTITY.md`:

```bash
cp "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/kevin-avatar.jpg" "$HOME_DIR/.claude/assets/kevin-avatar.jpg"
```

If a user avatar was staged in Step 5b (`<user-avatar>` path resolved to a local file), also:

```bash
cp "<user-avatar>" "$KNOWLEDGE_ROOT/user/assets/avatar.<ext>"
```

(extension preserved from the source). The staged `knowledge/user/profile.md` should then reference that path in its frontmatter or top-of-body.

Write the three identity files (Kevin-unique filenames — won't collide with anything pre-existing):

- `$HOME_DIR/SOUL.md` ← staged content from Step 2
- `$HOME_DIR/IDENTITY.md` ← staged content from Step 3
- `$HOME_DIR/USER.md` ← rendered from Steps 4 + 4b + 6 (template below)

Write the operating manual + Claude Code memory file. **Collision-aware**: if `$HOME_DIR/CLAUDE.md` already exists (plugin installed into an existing project), don't overwrite — write to `$HOME_DIR/CLAUDE.local.md` instead and inform the user.

```bash
if [ -f "$HOME_DIR/CLAUDE.md" ]; then
  CLAUDE_DEST="$HOME_DIR/CLAUDE.local.md"
  COLLISION="yes"
else
  CLAUDE_DEST="$HOME_DIR/CLAUDE.md"
  COLLISION="no"
fi
cp "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/CLAUDE.md" "$CLAUDE_DEST"

# Substitute placeholders: the @-import paths reflect the chosen
# KNOWLEDGE_ROOT / PROJECTS_ROOT (may differ from the defaults if the user
# picked "Specify" in Step 6; relative when under HOME_DIR, absolute otherwise),
# and {{PLATFORM}} records the OS detected in Step 0.
relpath() {
  case "$1" in
    "$HOME_DIR") echo "." ;;
    "$HOME_DIR"/*) echo "${1#$HOME_DIR/}" ;;
    *) echo "$1" ;;
  esac
}
KNOWLEDGE_REL="$(relpath "$KNOWLEDGE_ROOT")"
PROJECTS_REL="$(relpath "$PROJECTS_ROOT")"
# {{SHELL}} fills the Toolchain "Shell:" line per OS. On Windows, Claude Code's Bash tool runs under
# Git Bash (POSIX), not PowerShell, so Kevin's commands assume bash everywhere.
case "$KEVIN_OS" in
  macos)   SHELL_NOTE='zsh, Homebrew at `/opt/homebrew`' ;;
  windows) SHELL_NOTE='Git Bash (the POSIX shell Claude Code uses for its Bash tool on Windows)' ;;
  wsl)     SHELL_NOTE='bash (WSL2)' ;;
  *)       SHELL_NOTE='bash' ;;
esac
sed -i.bak \
  -e "s|{{KNOWLEDGE_REL}}|${KNOWLEDGE_REL}|g" \
  -e "s|{{PROJECTS_REL}}|${PROJECTS_REL}|g" \
  -e "s|{{PLATFORM}}|${PLATFORM_LABEL}|g" \
  -e "s|{{SHELL}}|${SHELL_NOTE}|g" \
  "$CLAUDE_DEST"
rm "$CLAUDE_DEST.bak"
```

- `$CLAUDE_DEST` ← `cp ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/CLAUDE.md` then placeholder-substituted so `@-imports` point at the active `KNOWLEDGE_ROOT` / `PROJECTS_ROOT`

If `COLLISION="yes"`, note this for the Step 9 status block so the user knows Kevin wrote to `CLAUDE.local.md`. Claude Code auto-loads `.local.md` files alongside the main `CLAUDE.md`, so the user's existing instructions and Kevin's coexist — Kevin's `@-imports` cascade still pulls in the identity stack.

Write a `.gitignore` so the home dir is safe to track in git out of the box. **Collision-aware**: if one already exists, don't overwrite — but append the Kevin-critical entries (`.claude/settings.local.json` holds local config, `.kevin/*` ignores the secrets dir + runtime tokens + logs while **tracking the `knowledge.json` compile cursor and the `version.json` template baseline**, `.obsidian/workspace.json` churns on every Obsidian pane move) if they aren't already covered. The first two must be gitignored or the user will leak secrets (`.kevin/secrets/` lives under `.kevin/*`) / churn on every Kevin run; the third saves the operator from a dirty working tree every time they open the vault.

Two records inside `.kevin/` must survive a clone or restore, so we un-ignore them while keeping the rest (tokens, logs) ignored: the compile cursor (`.kevin/knowledge.json`) is the *only* record of what's been ingested — rolled back (iCloud, restore, fresh clone), the next blind compile re-ingests everything and corrupts memory; the template baseline (`.kevin/version.json`) records which plugin version this home's scaffolded files are reconciled to — lost, upgrade-tracking resets to onboarding and the "you're behind" signal breaks.

```bash
if [ ! -f "$HOME_DIR/.gitignore" ]; then
  cp "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/.gitignore" "$HOME_DIR/.gitignore"
else
  # Existing .gitignore — append Kevin-critical entries if missing.
  # Upgrade a legacy bare `.kevin/` (ignores the cursor too) to the
  # cursor-tracking pattern: drop the line, the APPEND below re-adds it.
  if grep -qxF ".kevin/" "$HOME_DIR/.gitignore"; then
    grep -vxF ".kevin/" "$HOME_DIR/.gitignore" > "$HOME_DIR/.gitignore.tmp" && mv "$HOME_DIR/.gitignore.tmp" "$HOME_DIR/.gitignore"
  fi
  APPEND=""
  # The Claude Code Bash tool runs commands through an eval wrapper where '!' is
  # unusable — a literal leading '!' is mangled to '\!', and the '!' negation
  # operator errors ("command not found: !"). So: no '!' negation (positive grep +
  # else for the fresh case), grep '!'-free substrings, emit '!' via octal \041.
  BANG=$(printf '\041')
  grep -qxF ".claude/settings.local.json" "$HOME_DIR/.gitignore" || APPEND="${APPEND}.claude/settings.local.json"$'\n'
  if grep -qxF ".kevin/*" "$HOME_DIR/.gitignore"; then
    # Already ignores .kevin/* — re-add either negation if a legacy init missed it.
    grep -qF "kevin/knowledge.json" "$HOME_DIR/.gitignore" || APPEND="${APPEND}${BANG}.kevin/knowledge.json"$'\n'
    grep -qF "kevin/version.json" "$HOME_DIR/.gitignore" || APPEND="${APPEND}${BANG}.kevin/version.json"$'\n'
  else
    # Fresh: ignore runtime state, but track the two records that must survive a clone.
    APPEND="${APPEND}.kevin/*"$'\n'"${BANG}.kevin/knowledge.json"$'\n'"${BANG}.kevin/version.json"$'\n'
  fi
  grep -qxF ".obsidian/workspace.json" "$HOME_DIR/.gitignore" || APPEND="${APPEND}.obsidian/workspace.json"$'\n'
  grep -qxF ".obsidian/cache/" "$HOME_DIR/.gitignore" || APPEND="${APPEND}.obsidian/cache/"$'\n'
  if [ -n "$APPEND" ]; then
    printf '\n# agent-kevin\n%s' "$APPEND" >> "$HOME_DIR/.gitignore"
  fi
fi
```

Match is exact-line (`grep -xF`) — so `.kevin/*` won't false-match on `!.kevin/knowledge.json` or a partial substring, and the negation must follow the `.kevin/*` line (git can't re-include a file whose parent dir is ignored, so order matters). The full template (when written fresh) also ignores secrets (`.env*`, `keys.json`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `certificates/`) and OS cruft (`.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`); on collision we trust the user's existing patterns for those and only enforce the Kevin-specific entries.

Write project settings so the plugin auto-loads on subsequent launches AND the **always-on core** MCP tools are pre-granted (no per-call confirm prompts). Pack-gated tools are NOT granted here — they land in `permissions.allow` only when the matching `configure-skills` walk runs (Step 8 inline or `/agent-kevin:configure-skills` later).

- `$HOME_DIR/.claude/settings.json` ← JSON below, with `<PLUGIN_PATH>` substituted with the absolute value of `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`.

**`plansDirectory` — unify plan-mode with reports.** Claude Code writes plan-mode artefacts to the path in `plansDirectory` (default `./.claude/plans`). Kevin's `self-review` skill also writes code-change plans under `<HOME>/reports/plans/`, so we point the harness at the same folder — one home for every plan. The value is `./reports/plans` (relative to the project root, which is `$HOME_DIR`). **Preserve any pre-existing value**: if the project `settings.json` already has a `plansDirectory`, omit the key from the scaffold and let the deep-merge below keep the operator's choice. (Note: `self-review`'s age-sweep filters to its own plans by frontmatter `skill: self-review`, so raw plan-mode dumps sharing the folder are ignored — see that skill.)

**Fill hardening gaps the operator's user-global settings don't cover.** Kevin ships a baseline of security + quality defaults (denies, sandbox, effort/model, traffic kill, retention, render, Haiku-tier remap). Most operators won't have these in their user-global `~/.claude/settings.json` — for them, init must write the baseline into project settings so the protection is actually in effect. Operators who *do* already have these globally shouldn't get the same keys duplicated into the project — global already covers them, and re-writing them in project is redundant churn.

**Logic: gap-fill, not mirror.** Before writing the scaffold, `Read` `~/.claude/settings.json` (treat as empty `{}` if absent). For each baseline key below, check whether the operator already has it globally. If global covers it, **omit the key from the project scaffold** — inheritance handles it. If global does not cover it, **write the baseline value into the project scaffold**. Each `env.*` key is gap-filled independently; if all three are covered globally, omit the entire `env` block rather than writing an empty `{}`.

| Project-scaffold key | Baseline value to write when global is missing it | "Already covered" test against global |
|---|---|---|
| `cleanupPeriodDays` | `99999` | Any non-empty `cleanupPeriodDays` set globally |
| `model` | `"opus[1m]"` | Any non-empty `model` set globally |
| `effortLevel` | `"high"` | Any non-empty `effortLevel` set globally |
| `env.CLAUDE_CODE_NO_FLICKER` | `"1"` | Global `env.CLAUDE_CODE_NO_FLICKER` set to any truthy string |
| `env.CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC` | `"1"` | Global `env.CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC` set to any truthy string |
| `env.ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL` | `"claude-sonnet-4-6"` | Any non-empty `env.ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL` set globally |
| `permissions.deny` | The full deny list below | Global `permissions.deny` is non-empty (any deny suggests the operator is curating their own — don't fight it) |
| `sandbox` | The full sandbox block below | Global `sandbox.enabled === true` (sandbox is binary — if globally enabled, project doesn't need its own) |

Baseline `permissions.deny` to write when global doesn't already have a deny list. It has a **cross-platform core** plus an **OS-specific tail** (credential store + crypto-wallet dirs, which live in different places per OS). Concatenate the core with the tail selected by `$KEVIN_OS` from Step 0 — never ship the macOS `~/Library/...` paths on a Windows/Linux/WSL home, where they're dead entries that protect nothing. (On native Windows, `$KEVIN_OS` is `windows` and the Windows `~/AppData/...` tail below applies.)

Cross-platform core (always written). The `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, etc. entries resolve correctly on Windows too, since Git Bash maps `~` to `%USERPROFILE%`:

```json
[
  "Bash(rm -rf *)",
  "Bash(rm -fr *)",
  "Bash(sudo *)",
  "Bash(mkfs *)",
  "Bash(dd *)",
  "Bash(wget *|bash*)",
  "Bash(wget *| bash*)",
  "Bash(git push --force*)",
  "Bash(git push *--force*)",
  "Bash(git reset --hard*)",
  "Bash(curl *|sh*)",
  "Bash(curl *| sh*)",
  "Edit(~/.bashrc)",
  "Edit(~/.zshrc)",
  "Read(**/.env)",
  "Read(**/.env.*)",
  "Read(//**/.kevin/secrets/**)",
  "Read(**/secrets/**)",
  "Read(**/credentials/**)",
  "Read(**/*.pem)",
  "Read(**/*.key)",
  "Read(~/.ssh/id_*)",
  "Read(~/.ssh/*.pem)",
  "Read(~/.ssh/authorized_keys)",
  "Edit(~/.ssh/id_*)",
  "Edit(~/.ssh/*.pem)",
  "Edit(~/.ssh/authorized_keys)",
  "Read(~/.gnupg/**)",
  "Read(~/.aws/**)",
  "Read(~/.azure/**)",
  "Read(~/.git-credentials)",
  "Read(~/.docker/config.json)",
  "Read(~/.kube/**)",
  "Read(~/.npmrc)",
  "Read(~/.npm/**)",
  "Read(~/.pypirc)",
  "Read(~/.gem/credentials)"
]
```

OS-specific tail — append the block matching `$KEVIN_OS`:

`macos`:

```json
[
  "Read(~/Library/Keychains/**)",
  "Read(~/Library/Application Support/**/metamask*/**)",
  "Read(~/Library/Application Support/**/electrum*/**)",
  "Read(~/Library/Application Support/**/exodus*/**)",
  "Read(~/Library/Application Support/**/phantom*/**)",
  "Read(~/Library/Application Support/**/solflare*/**)"
]
```

`linux` / `wsl`:

```json
[
  "Read(~/.local/share/keyrings/**)",
  "Read(~/.config/**/electrum*/**)",
  "Read(~/.config/**/exodus*/**)",
  "Read(~/.config/**/Exodus/**)"
]
```

`windows` (Git Bash maps `~` to `%USERPROFILE%`, so these `~/AppData/...` globs resolve to `%APPDATA%` / `%LOCALAPPDATA%`):

```json
[
  "Read(~/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Credentials/**)",
  "Read(~/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Vault/**)",
  "Read(~/AppData/Roaming/**/electrum*/**)",
  "Read(~/AppData/Roaming/Exodus/**)",
  "Read(~/AppData/Roaming/**/exodus*/**)",
  "Read(~/AppData/Local/**/metamask*/**)"
]
```

For `unknown`, write the core only (no tail). The OS tail is best-effort wallet-folder coverage — names vary by app version, so don't treat absence as a guarantee.

Baseline `sandbox` block to write when global `sandbox.enabled !== true`:

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "failIfUnavailable": true,
  "autoAllowBashIfSandboxed": true,
  "allowUnsandboxedCommands": false,
  "filesystem": {
    "denyRead": [".kevin/secrets"]
  },
  "credentials": {
    "files": [{ "path": ".kevin/secrets", "mode": "deny" }]
  },
  "network": {
    "allowedDomains": [
      "github.com",
      "api.github.com",
      "raw.githubusercontent.com",
      "objects.githubusercontent.com",
      "registry.npmjs.org",
      "*.npmjs.org",
      "docs.anthropic.com",
      "docs.claude.com"
    ]
  }
}
```

The `filesystem.denyRead` directory entry is the **second** layer protecting secrets: it
blocks `cat`/`grep` of `.kevin/secrets/` via the **Bash** tool, which a `permissions.deny
Read(...)` rule does **not** cover (that gates the Read tool only). It points at the
directory (no glob) so the OS denies it and everything under it — a `**/.kevin/secrets/**`
glob would miss, because gitignore-style `**` won't descend into the `.kevin` dot-dir. The
`credentials.files` entry applies the same file-read block (and is the home for env-var
unsetting) on Claude Code v2.1.187+, and is ignored on older versions. Both the Read-tool
and sandbox layers are needed. (Sandbox is unavailable on native Windows — there the
Read-tool deny is the only layer; flag that secrets aren't OS-protected on Windows.)

**Do not** touch global keys outside this baseline (`hooks`, `statusLine`, `theme`, `verbose`, other `env.*` entries, other `permissions.allow` entries, `enabledPlugins`) — those are operator-personal, not project-security. Hooks especially: plugin hooks come from `hooks/hooks.json` once registered; mirroring global hooks here would double-fire.

**Critical — never overwrite an existing project `settings.json`.** If `$HOME_DIR/.claude/settings.json` already exists (re-init, or the home was a pre-existing project), `Read` it first and **deep-merge** the scaffold into it. The merged JSON is what gets written back. Rules:

- **Scalars** (`model`, `effortLevel`, `cleanupPeriodDays`, `plansDirectory`, `$schema`, `env.*` string values): existing project value wins. Skip the key when merging — don't replace.
- **Arrays** (`permissions.allow`, `permissions.deny`, `sandbox.network.allowedDomains`, any `allowWrite`/`denyRead` arrays): union with the operator's existing entries + dedupe. `sandbox.credentials.files` is an object-array — union + dedupe by `path`. Don't reorder or remove anything they already had.
- **Objects** (`permissions`, `sandbox`, `sandbox.network`, `enabledPlugins`, `env`, `hooks`): recurse with the same rules.
- **`enabledPlugins`**: special case — set `"agent-kevin@agentlayer": true` even if the key already exists with a different value (the operator just ran init, so they want it enabled). Other plugin entries pass through untouched.
- **`hooks`**: never touch — operator-owned end-to-end. The scaffold doesn't author any hooks block.

Concrete approach: `Read` the existing file (treat as `{}` if absent), build the merged object in-memory per the rules above, then `Write` the full merged JSON back. Do not invoke `jq` or shell tooling for the merge — the orchestrator has the file content already and can deep-merge cleanly without subshell escaping risks.

**Why no `extraKnownMarketplaces` entry?** The marketplace registration was already saved to the user's global `~/.claude/settings.json` when they first ran `/plugin marketplace add` (Option A) or were prompted to trust the marketplace (Option B). Duplicating it in project settings is redundant — only `enabledPlugins` is needed here to opt this specific home into agent-kevin.

**Why only the always-on core is granted here.** Plugin-bundled MCP tools register into the session regardless of permissions — `permissions.allow` only controls whether tool calls trigger a confirm prompt. The "always-on core" (`ping`, `capture`, `compile_*`, `knowledge_lint`, `task_*`, `links_rewrite`, `memory_prune`, `report_write`, `dashboard`, `setup_worktree`, `run_upgrade`) needs no external config; the pack-gated tools need API keys or OAuth that only get set when the user opts into the matching pack. Granting them at init time would mean `settings.json` advertises packs the user never configured. Conditional grants keep `settings.json` an accurate audit trail.

**Bucket model** (which flow writes which permissions):

| Bucket | Tools | Granted when |
|---|---|---|
| Always-on core | `ping`, `capture`, `compile_*`, `memory_prune`, `task_*`, `links_rewrite`, `report_write`, `dashboard`, `setup_worktree`, `run_upgrade` | `/init` (above) |
| SEO-gated | `serpapi_search`, `open_page_rank`, `gsc_*`, `page_speed_*`, `google_auth` | configure-skills A.2a (SEO walk) |
| Browser-gated | `web_search`, `browser_*` | configure-skills A.2b (Browser walk) |
| Database-gated | `database_list`, `database_query`, `database_schema`, `database_fork` | configure-skills A.2c (Database walk) |

The allow list also carries nine **skill** grants. Skills register regardless of permissions — the grant only suppresses the confirm prompt on model invocation (whether Kevin auto-fires the skill directly or one skill invokes another via the Skill tool). `Skill(agent-kevin:dashboard)`, `Skill(agent-kevin:where-am-i)`, `Skill(agent-kevin:humanizer)`, and `Skill(agent-kevin:sync)` are **active**: all are model-invocable (no `disable-model-invocation`). `dashboard` refreshes-and-opens the Agent OS dashboard on a plain "refresh the dashboard"; `where-am-i` answers "where am I" directly and is also invoked by `dashboard` and `sync` to freshen the session radar (one source of truth for the radar); `humanizer` fires when Kevin is asked to strip AI-writing tells from a draft; `sync` runs the full state refresh (compile → lint → flywheel → briefing → dashboards) and is chained by `upgrade` after a HOME migration. `Skill(agent-kevin:setup-worktree)`, `Skill(agent-kevin:plan-spec)`, `Skill(agent-kevin:simple-simplify)`, `Skill(agent-kevin:upgrade)`, and `Skill(agent-kevin:release)` are **latent**: all currently set `disable-model-invocation` (slash-only — `/plan-spec`, `/simple-simplify`, `/upgrade`, `/release`), so the grant does nothing until that flag is dropped; they're kept here so the slash invocation never prompts. `upgrade` applies pending HOME migrations after a `/plugin update`; `release` (producer-only) cuts a versioned release + CHANGELOG entry.

**Why the Bash entries are scoped this narrowly:** broad patterns like `Bash(git *)` or `Bash(curl *)` would also authorize destructive forms (`git push --force`, `git reset --hard`, `curl attacker.com | sh`). The patterns above cover the read-mostly + scaffold-creation commands core skills actually use (`git log/status/diff/config`, `date`, `readlink`, `ls`, `find`, `cat`, `mkdir -p`, `test`, `echo`) — nothing that mutates source-control state or hits the network. **Network/curl is intentionally NOT pre-granted anywhere** — `wordpress-rest` and any other skill that makes outbound HTTP confirms on first call; the user picks "Always allow" to lock the grant to their actual URL pattern (much tighter than blanket `Bash(curl *)`).

Do **not** add a `hooks` block here. Hooks come from the plugin's own `hooks/hooks.json` once the plugin is registered. Sandbox lands only via the user-global gap-fill above (never authored fresh in the scaffold when global already enables it). API keys + external MCP server config land in `settings.local.json` and `<HOME>/.mcp.json` later via `/agent-kevin:configure-skills` — those files stay separate.

USER.md template:

```markdown
# About <NAME>

<AVATAR_LINE>

Kevin reads this every session (via `@-import` in `CLAUDE.md`). The headline of who I am and how I want Kevin to work with me.

## Identity

- **Name:** <NAME>
- **Timezone:** <TIMEZONE>

## How to Talk to Me

<COMMUNICATION_STYLE_PARAGRAPH>

_(Examples to pick from or replace: "Direct and technical, no preamble." / "Plain English, walk me through it." / "Bullet-point summaries first, details on request." / "I push back — expect me to challenge your first answer.")_

## Hard Rules

<VALUES_OR_PLACEHOLDER>

_(Anything Kevin should respect about your personal values, ethics, taboos, or hard preferences. Optional — leave empty if not applicable.)_

## Where Things Live

- **Primary codebase:** `<KEVIN_CODE_PATH>` (also exposed as `$KEVIN_CODE_PATH` for shell/MCP use)

## Deeper

These files hold my evolving long-form knowledge. Kevin reads them on demand and updates them on compile.

- [Profile](knowledge/user/profile.md)
- [Skills](knowledge/user/skills.md)
- [Preferences](knowledge/user/preferences.md)
- [Career](knowledge/user/career.md)
- [Interests](knowledge/user/interests.md)
```

If Step 4b returned `skip`, omit the `## Where Things Live` section entirely — Kevin's a personal agent and many operators have no primary codebase, so an empty placeholder is just noise. The operator can add it later by setting `env.KEVIN_CODE_PATH` and re-running compile.

`<AVATAR_LINE>` rendering:
- If Step 5b staged a user avatar at `<KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/user/assets/avatar.<ext>` → render `![Avatar](knowledge/user/assets/avatar.<ext>)` (path relative to `<HOME_DIR>`, since CLAUDE.md `@-imports` USER.md from there).
- If Step 5b was skipped → omit the line entirely (no empty placeholder).

**Write the five `knowledge/user/<facet>.md` files — preservation-aware.** For each of `profile.md`, `skills.md`, `preferences.md`, `career.md`, `interests.md`:

1. **File missing OR currently the empty-with-frontmatter stub** (frontmatter block only, no body content beyond whitespace): write the staged content.
   - If Step 5 ran with URLs and synthesised content for this facet → write the synthesised version.
   - For `preferences.md` specifically, even without Step 5 URLs, write the **shipped defaults** below (not an empty stub).
   - Otherwise → write the empty-with-frontmatter stub.
2. **File exists with body content AND Step 5 did NOT synthesise content for this facet**: skip the write entirely. Operator-curated content is preserved — this includes any edits the operator made to the shipped `preferences.md` defaults.
3. **File exists with body content AND Step 5 DID synthesise content for this facet**: `AskUserQuestion`:

   > `knowledge/user/<facet>.md` already has content. The URLs you pasted in Step 5 synthesised a fresh version. How should Kevin handle this?
   >
   > - Keep existing (recommended) — discard the synthesised version, your file stays as-is
   > - Overwrite — replace with the synthesised version (existing content lost)
   > - Merge — append synthesised facts under a `## Synthesised from URLs (<DATE>)` heading at the bottom, leaving existing content untouched

   Default: Keep existing. Apply the operator's choice per-facet.

"Empty-with-frontmatter stub" = the file's body (post-frontmatter) is empty or whitespace-only. Treat any non-whitespace body content — bullets, paragraphs, headings — as operator content worth preserving.

**`profile.md` always carries `## Signal Topics`.** The staged `profile.md` content — whether synthesised from Step 5 URLs or the empty stub — must end with a `## Signal Topics` section built from Step 6b, with the descriptive lead `morning-briefing` looks for:

```markdown
## Signal Topics

News/research topics to track for briefings and signals. Used by morning-briefing and any task that needs topical web search.

- <topic from Step 6b>
- <topic from Step 6b>
- …
```

This section is what powers the news clusters in every morning brief, so it must exist from day one even when Step 5 was skipped. **Bounded preservation exception:** if `profile.md` already has body content (case 2/3 above) but has **no** `## Signal Topics` heading, append this section to the end — additive only, never replacing existing content. If it already has one, leave it untouched (the operator or a prior compile owns it).

**Why `preferences.md` ships with defaults**: OSS users may not have a `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` of their own with universal communication / workflow / engineering opinions. The CLAUDE.md template already `@-imports` this file every session, so the defaults flow into context automatically. Users can edit them, delete sections that don't fit, or **promote anything they love to their own `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`** so it applies across every Claude Code project on their machine. On re-run, edits are preserved by the body-content guard above.

Shipped `preferences.md` defaults:

````markdown
---
title: Preferences
created: <YYYY-MM-DD>
updated: <YYYY-MM-DD>
---

# Preferences

> **Shipped defaults.** These are sensible, generic defaults so Kevin has opinions out of the box even before you fill in personal preferences. Edit freely. If a section fits how you'd want every Claude Code project to behave, promote it to your own `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and delete it here.

## Communication

- Concise by default — skip preamble, get to the answer.
- Direct over diplomatic. Honest over flattering. Push back when something is wrong instead of agreeing reflexively.
- When ambiguous, ask one clarifying question rather than guessing broadly.
- "I don't know" is a valid answer — better than a confident-sounding guess.
- Don't over-apologize. Own a mistake in one sentence and move on.

## Workflow

- **Plan before non-trivial tasks** (3+ steps or architecture decisions). Surface tradeoffs and assumptions before building.
- **Verify before claim.** Anything specific — numbers, statuses, page state, library behavior — gets a source check or "I don't know".
- **Never mark a task complete** without proving it works (tests pass, feature verified, change reviewed).
- **For UI / frontend changes**, exercise the feature in a browser before reporting done. Type checks verify code correctness, not feature correctness.
- If something goes sideways mid-task, stop and re-plan instead of pushing through.

## Engineering Defaults

_(Delete this section if you don't write code.)_

- **Simplicity first.** Minimum code that solves the problem. No speculative abstractions, no error handling for impossible scenarios, no features beyond what was asked.
- **Surgical changes.** Touch only what the task requires. Don't refactor adjacent code or "improve" unrelated formatting.
- **Comments only when WHY is non-obvious.** Well-named code already explains WHAT. Skip docstring novellas.
- **Trust framework / SDK signals** over scraping text output. When a library exposes structured errors or status, use them.
- **Match existing project conventions** over personal preference.

## Hard No

_(Add anything Kevin should never do — sensitive content, off-limits topics, vendor lock-ins, etc. Leave empty if no hard rules apply.)_

- _(empty)_
````

If Step 5 URL synthesis surfaced anything that contradicts these defaults (e.g., the user's blog reveals they prefer step-by-step walkthroughs over terse answers), append a `## Synthesized from URLs` section below the defaults rather than overwriting them — let the user resolve the conflict later.

Also write `.claude/settings.local.json` so the file exists with the correct gitignored permissions from day one. The only env keys init owns are the **optional** primary-codebase pair from Step 4b — and only when a path was actually captured.

**Secrets live in `.kevin/secrets/.env`, not here.** Credential pack keys (`PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`, `SERPAPI_KEY`, `OPENPAGERANK_API_KEY`, every `KEVIN_DB_*`) go in the deny-gated `.kevin/secrets/.env` — `/agent-kevin:configure-skills` ensures that file exists and tells the user which `KEY=value` lines to add (the file is deny-gated, so Claude can't write its contents; the user edits it). Kevin's config loader surfaces it into `process.env` at boot; the settings `env` block is no longer a secrets store. `GSC_SITE_URL` is the one pack key that **stays** in `settings.local.json` `env` — it's not a credential and two skills (`wordpress-rest`, `google-search-audit`) read it straight from the Bash environment, which only the settings `env` block reaches. Google OAuth client JSON + tokens live in `.kevin/secrets/google/`. This keeps `settings.local.json` non-secret and an accurate audit trail of what the operator opted into.

The rule: **init owns env keys that are universal to every operator; configure-skills owns pack-gated env keys.** Kevin's only universal-infra keys are the optional codebase pair, so:

- **Step 4b captured a real path:** write `KEVIN_CODE_PATH` and derive `KEVIN_GIT_REPOS` to the same path (it surfaces that repo's recent git activity in the SessionStart `## Recent Git Activity` block — operators can append more later, `,/path/to/other/repo`, without touching plugin code).

  ```json
  {
    "env": {
      "KEVIN_CODE_PATH": "<KEVIN_CODE_PATH>",
      "KEVIN_GIT_REPOS": "<KEVIN_CODE_PATH>"
    }
  }
  ```

- **Step 4b returned `skip`:** write `{}` — no orphan empty keys. A code path is genuinely optional for a personal agent; the operator can add it later by editing this file.

- **If the file already exists:** never overwrite existing values. Merge in the codebase pair only if (a) Step 4b captured a real path AND (b) `env.KEVIN_CODE_PATH` / `env.KEVIN_GIT_REPOS` are currently absent or the empty string. Leave all other keys untouched. configure-skills walks merge in pack-gated keys via §D when activated.

We intentionally do **not** prompt for any secret values in chat (see the rule below); the codebase path is not a secret — it's captured in Step 4b's plain-chat prompt.

**Never solicit values via chat** — secrets must not enter the session transcript or the Anthropic API. The session-capture hook redacts known prefixes (`pplx-…`, `sk-…`, `AIza…`, etc.) as defense-in-depth, but the safer move is to keep values off the wire entirely.

The Step 8 pack walks handle non-secret config (permission grants, Google OAuth file drop, host-scoped curl grants), plant the non-secret `GSC_SITE_URL` placeholder, and ensure `.kevin/secrets/.env` exists — but defer all secret lines and *value* entry to the editor. Step 9's "Next" block instructs the user explicitly.

**Write `knowledge/index.md` — preservation-aware.** Operators add catalog bullets over time (linking to concepts they've authored manually).

- File missing → write the scaffold below.
- File exists with any non-whitespace body content → skip the write entirely.

Scaffold:

```markdown
---
title: Knowledge — Master Index
created: <YYYY-MM-DD>
updated: <YYYY-MM-DD>
---

# Knowledge

Master catalog of Kevin's compiled knowledge. Kevin keeps this current via `/agent-kevin:knowledge-compile`.

## User (<NAME>)

Long-form, evolving knowledge about the operator. Five facets, each updated as compile reveals durable facts.

- [[user/profile]] — bio, identity, family, faith, location, languages, calling hours
- [[user/skills]] — technical stack and domain expertise
- [[user/preferences]] — communication style, workflow rules, coding style, ethical guardrails
- [[user/career]] — work history, employers, roles, equity grants, education, certifications
- [[user/interests]] — vision projects, startup ideas, signal topics

## Concepts (cross-cutting patterns)

Cross-cutting patterns spanning ≥2 projects. Synthesized insights, not project summaries. The four seeded below describe the system itself; new concepts land here as `concepts/<slug>.md` after `/agent-kevin:knowledge-compile` runs.

- [[concepts/karpathy-wiki]] — LLM-maintained knowledge base architecture (the pattern behind this whole system)
- [[concepts/markdown-native-task-management]] — File-per-task with YAML frontmatter, Obsidian UI, programmatic enforcement
- [[concepts/self-evolution-loop]] — Feedback-driven prompt improvement: capture → compile → learnings → optional approved diffs
- [[concepts/audit-premise-decay]] — Inherited audits, thresholds, and metrics drift; verify the premise (not just the recommendations) before executing

## Memory

- [[memory/index]] — hot context loaded every session: daily-memory manifest, active threads, recent decisions, pending items, key context, learnings

## Reports (transient skill outputs — 3rd-degree context)

- [reports/index](../reports/index.md) — dated audit trail of all skill outputs (briefings, plans, etc.). Read-only network of links; not absorbed into memory or concepts. Promote anything durable into `raw/inbox/` (via `kevin capture --file=...` or a direct drop) and compile. File is auto-created by `report_write` on the first reporting-skill call.

## Projects

Operational work units. Each has its own README, tasks/, and tracker. Project READMEs live outside the wiki and use markdown links (not wikilinks).

Cross-project task dashboard: [projects/TASKS.md](../projects/TASKS.md).

## Raw (inputs to compile)

- `raw/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — auto-captured session transcripts (single file per day, no suffixes)
- `raw/user/feedback.md` — append-only correction + reaction log; compiled into [[memory/index]] `## Learnings`
- `raw/inbox/` — drop any input here (or use `kevin capture`) for compile to distill into concepts
- `raw/archive/inbox/` — compiled inbox items land here post-archive
```

Substitute `<NAME>` with the operator's name from Step 4a and `<YYYY-MM-DD>` with today's date. The Reports link points at a path that doesn't exist until `report_write` runs once — Obsidian renders the unresolved link gracefully, and the file materialises on first use.

**Write `knowledge/memory/index.md` — strict preservation.** This is the highest-stakes file in the tree — months of `/agent-kevin:knowledge-compile` output (Active Threads, Recent Decisions, Learnings) live here.

- File missing OR file body is empty/whitespace-only → write the master-index scaffold with empty placeholder sections.
- File exists with any non-whitespace body content → **never overwrite**. Skip the write entirely, no prompt. The Step 0 prompt already committed to preserving this; honour it unconditionally.

For `projects/TASKS.md`, write this scaffold — the task-list sections render automatically when the `dashboard` tool first runs (which the auto-rebuild on the user's first task creation will trigger):

```markdown
> Tasks hub — auto-generated by Kevin from task frontmatter on every mutation. Do not edit this file directly: tasks change via the task tools, goals via the weekly-goals / monthly-goals / yearly-goals skills.

<!-- GOALS:START -->
## Weekly Goals

_No weekly goals set yet — run the weekly-goals skill to set them._

## Monthly Goals

_No monthly goals set yet — run the monthly-goals skill (Kevin proposes on the 1st of each Hijri month)._

## Yearly Goals

_No yearly goals set yet — run the yearly-goals skill to plan the year by quarters._
<!-- GOALS:END -->
```

After scaffolding, call `mcp__plugin_agent-kevin_kevin__dashboard` once so the file has its (empty) Active/Blocked/Overdue/Stale/Recently Closed sections rendered from day one — no scaffold drift (this also writes the first `dashboard.html`).

**Seed concept articles — preservation-aware.** Four bundled concepts describe the system itself (the wiki pattern, the task system, the feedback loop, the audit-premise-decay heuristic). Seeding them means a freshly-initialised home has working `[[concepts/*]]` wikilinks from day one instead of broken refs, and the operator can read them to understand the architecture they just installed.

```bash
TODAY="$(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
for src in "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"/templates/knowledge/concepts/*.md; do
  [ -f "$src" ] || continue
  dest="$KNOWLEDGE_ROOT/concepts/$(basename "$src")"
  if [ -f "$dest" ]; then
    continue   # operator already has it — never overwrite
  fi
  sed "s/{{INIT_DATE}}/${TODAY}/g" "$src" > "$dest"
done
```

Idempotent by file: any existing concept file is preserved (the `[ -f ]` check passes for empty files too — operators who want a seed permanently gone can `: > path/to/concept.md` to leave a 0-byte placeholder, rather than `rm`-ing it and getting it re-seeded on re-init).

**Seed coding rules — preservation-aware.** The plugin bundles path-scoped coding rules under `templates/rules/*.md` (`typescript.md`, `swift.md`). Claude Code auto-loads any `.claude/rules/*.md` whose `paths:` frontmatter matches the file being edited, so seeding them gives the home sane language defaults from day one. The operator can edit or delete any of them.

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME_DIR/.claude/rules"
for src in "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"/templates/rules/*.md; do
  [ -f "$src" ] || continue
  dest="$HOME_DIR/.claude/rules/$(basename "$src")"
  [ -f "$dest" ] && continue   # operator already has it — never overwrite
  cp "$src" "$dest"
done
```

Idempotent by file, same as the concept seeding above: an existing rule file is never overwritten.

## Step 8 — Optional: configure skill packs

The scaffold is done. Before showing the final confirmation, offer to wire up API keys + MCP servers + permissions for the optional packs. This is exactly what `/agent-kevin:configure-skills` does — invoking inline so the user doesn't have to run it as a separate command after relaunch.

`AskUserQuestion` (**multi-select**, so the user can tick any combination):

> **Activate skill packs now?**
> Each pack already ships loaded with the plugin. Activating a pack grants its MCP tool permissions in `settings.json` (so calls don't re-prompt), plants the non-secret `GSC_SITE_URL` placeholder in `settings.local.json`, and ensures `.kevin/secrets/.env` exists for the secret keys you'll add via your editor. Skip entirely if you want to come back later via `/agent-kevin:configure-skills`.
>
> - ☐ SEO pack (serpapi · open-page-rank · GSC · page-speed · WP · search-audit)
> - ☑ Browser pack **(recommended)** (perplexity search + browser screenshot/pdf/record + browser-flows)
> - ☐ Database pack (connect Kevin to one or more Postgres databases — read-only `database_list`/`database_schema`/`database_query` + `database_fork` to clone a local DB for risky schema work)
> - ☐ Third-party libraries (aaron-he-zhu SEO/GEO skills, coreyhaines31 marketing playbooks, others)

Default-select **Browser** (recommended — Playwright's capture tools work immediately with no key, and Perplexity just waits on a key). Leave the others unticked; the user ticks any they want.

Behavior on the response:
- **Each ticked option**: run the matching configure-skills section in order — SEO (A.2a) → Browser (A.2b) → Database (A.2c) → Third-party (F). The walks **never prompt for API key values or connection strings in chat** — they add MCP grants to `settings.json`, plant the `GSC_SITE_URL` placeholder, and ensure `.kevin/secrets/.env` exists. The user adds the secret lines + values via their editor after relaunch.
- **Nothing ticked**: skip — note "skill packs not activated — run `/agent-kevin:configure-skills` after relaunch" for Step 9's status block. Don't touch settings files.

For each picked option: **delegate to configure-skills** — open `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/configure-skills/SKILL.md` and follow the matching section. Honor every per-skill skip option inside that flow; don't force the user through items they don't want.

---

## Step 9 — Confirmation

Print the same banner as Step 1 for visual continuity, with `===KEVIN=== 🍌` standing alone on its line (no trailing word). The "Ready" line follows below, separated by a blank line.

````
```
 ╔═╗ ╔═╗ ╔═╗ ╔╗╔ ╔╦╗
 ╠═╣ ║ ╦ ║╣  ║║║  ║ 
 ╩ ╩ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╝╚╝  ╩ 
===KEVIN=== 🍌
```
````

Then a blank line, then the **Ready** heading:

> 🟢 **Ready**

Blank line, then the status block as plain prose (one row per line, two-space gutter between label and value):

> ✅ Home          `<HOME_DIR>`
> ✅ Identity      SOUL.md · IDENTITY.md · USER.md
> ✅ Operating manual   `<MANUAL_PATH>` (`@-imports` the above)
> ✅ Plugin reg    .claude/settings.json (auto-loads agent-kevin next launch — no `--plugin-dir` needed)
> ✅ Knowledge     `<FACET_FILES_FILLED>/5` facets populated `<from blog · LinkedIn · GitHub, if Step 5 ran>`
> ✅ Indexes       knowledge/index.md · knowledge/memory/index.md · projects/TASKS.md
> ✅ Dashboard     dashboard.html — open it in any browser; rebuilt by every sync or `/agent-kevin:dashboard`
> ✅ Concepts      4 seeded: karpathy-wiki · markdown-native-task-management · self-evolution-loop · audit-premise-decay
> `<SKILL_PACK_ROW>`
> ⏳ Custom skills none — author with `/agent-kevin:configure-skills`

For `<SKILL_PACK_ROW>`, render the row based on what Step 8 did. Note: "activated" here means permissions granted + `.kevin/secrets/.env` ensured (and the `GSC_SITE_URL` placeholder planted), not key values — those come from the user editing `.kevin/secrets/.env` (secrets) and `settings.local.json` (`GSC_SITE_URL`).
- If user skipped Step 8 entirely → `⏳ Skill packs   none activated — run /agent-kevin:configure-skills later`
- If user activated any pack → `✅ Skill packs   <list, e.g. "SEO (perms granted; fill SERPAPI_KEY + OPENPAGERANK_API_KEY in .kevin/secrets/.env, GSC_SITE_URL in settings.local.json), Browser (perms granted; fill PERPLEXITY_API_KEY in .kevin/secrets/.env), Database (perms granted; fill KEVIN_DB_<NAME> in .kevin/secrets/.env)">`

Use ✅ for what landed and ⏳ for deferred (the hourglass implies "queued for later"). Don't list `<FACET_FILES_FILLED>/5` if Step 5 was skipped — just say "stubs only" instead.

For the operating-manual row:
- No collision: `<MANUAL_PATH>` = `CLAUDE.md`
- Collision detected (pre-existing CLAUDE.md): `<MANUAL_PATH>` = `CLAUDE.local.md` — also append a callout line:
  > ℹ️ Existing `CLAUDE.md` detected at home — Kevin's operating manual was written to `CLAUDE.local.md` alongside it. Both files load; your prior CLAUDE.md is untouched.

Blank line, then the **Next** heading (same style as Ready), then the relaunch prose. **Important: the user must exit and relaunch** so the new `.claude/settings.json` is picked up by Claude Code:

> 🚀 **Next**
>
> **Fill any secret/env values.** Two files, by sensitivity:
> - **Secrets → `<HOME_DIR>/.kevin/secrets/.env`** (0600, deny-gated, gitignored; Kevin loads it into the environment at boot). If you ticked SEO / Browser / Database at Step 8, the walk created this file — add the lines you need (it's deny-gated, so you fill it yourself):
>   - `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` — Browser pack (sign up at https://perplexity.ai/settings/api)
>   - `SERPAPI_KEY` — SEO pack (https://serpapi.com)
>   - `OPENPAGERANK_API_KEY` — SEO pack (https://openpagerank.com)
>   - `KEVIN_DB_<NAME>` — Database pack: one Postgres connection string per line
> - **Private config → `<HOME_DIR>/.claude/settings.local.json`** `env`: init wrote `KEVIN_CODE_PATH` / `KEVIN_GIT_REPOS` if you gave a codebase path at Step 4b (else `{}`). Set `GSC_SITE_URL` here (your Search Console property — not a secret, and Bash-based SEO skills read it from here) before running `mcp__plugin_agent-kevin_kevin__google_auth`. For Google, drop the OAuth client JSON at `<HOME_DIR>/.kevin/secrets/google/google-oauth-client.json`.
>
> Didn't tick a pack at Step 8? Run `/agent-kevin:configure-skills` later — it adds permissions, ensures `.kevin/secrets/.env` exists, and tells you the lines to add via your editor. Tools whose key is missing stay loaded but return "missing env var" if called — add the line any time later and the next session picks it up.
>
> **Always launch Kevin from its home — `<HOME_DIR>` — and set `KEVIN_HOME` as a safety net.** Kevin's MCP server resolves all paths from `cwd` by default, so the simplest habit is `cd <HOME_DIR> && claude` every time. But if you ever open Claude from somewhere else — a subdir of the home, a sibling repo, the user-level session-capture hook from the README, or just by accident — Kevin silently resolves to the wrong place. To make it robust no matter where you launch, add this to your **user-level** settings at `~/.claude/settings.json` under `env` (create the file if it doesn't exist):
>
> ```json
> { "env": { "KEVIN_HOME": "<HOME_DIR>" } }
> ```
>
> With that set, Kevin always finds its home regardless of your current directory. (You can verify it any time on the dashboard's System → Environment page — there's an info tooltip explaining what it does.)
>
> **One-time MCP-server install.** Kevin's MCP server runs from the plugin directory and needs its node_modules. From a separate terminal (or after `/exit`), run:
>
> ```bash
> cd <PLUGIN_PATH>/mcp-server && bun install
> ```
>
> (where `<PLUGIN_PATH>` is the absolute path of the plugin — same as `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` during this init.) This pulls Chromium for Playwright (~150MB) and is required even if you installed via `/plugin marketplace add`. Skip if you've already done it for another Kevin home.
>
> **Then relaunch.** The plugin registration in `.claude/settings.json` only takes effect on a fresh session. Exit now (`/exit` or Ctrl+D) and relaunch:
>
> ```bash
> cd <HOME_DIR>
> claude
> ```
>
> **Watch for a marketplace trust prompt.** On first relaunch, Claude Code asks "this project wants to register a marketplace and enable a plugin — trust it?" **Accept it.** If you dismiss/miss the prompt, the plugin won't load and the SessionStart banner won't appear — recover by running:
>
> ```
> /plugin marketplace add <PLUGIN_DIR>
> /plugin install agent-kevin@agentlayer
> ```
>
> (where `<PLUGIN_DIR>` is the absolute path of the cloned plugin — same path as `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` during this init session.)
>
> Once the plugin is loaded, try:
>
> - `/agent-kevin:dashboard` — open the Agent OS dashboard (your whole setup on one page)
> - `/agent-kevin:configure-skills` — configure skill packs (SEO, Browser) or author a custom skill
> - `/agent-kevin:create-project` — start your first project
> - `/agent-kevin:morning-briefing` — see what Kevin knows about you
> - `mcp__plugin_agent-kevin_kevin__ping` — health check the MCP server
>
> Open `<HOME_DIR>` in Obsidian to view/edit your wiki.

## Notes for you (the orchestrating Claude)

- **Idempotent.** Step 0 catches re-runs and surfaces the explicit write list. Step 7's facet + index writes preserve operator-curated content (`knowledge/user/*.md`, `knowledge/index.md`) and never replace existing compile output (`knowledge/memory/index.md`). Re-running on an active HOME is safe.
- **No secrets in identity files.** API keys go to `<HOME>/.claude/settings.local.json` via the configure-skills flow (Step 8 inline or `/agent-kevin:configure-skills` later), never to CLAUDE/SOUL/IDENTITY/USER.
- **CLAUDE.md (or CLAUDE.local.md) is never customised.** Copy verbatim. SOUL.md adjusts tone. USER.md gets the user's headline. IDENTITY.md adjusts role.
- **Stage before write.** Build all content through Steps 2–6. Only Step 7 writes to disk.
- **Step 8 delegates, doesn't duplicate.** When the user opts to configure skills inline, *read* `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/configure-skills/SKILL.md` and follow its Section A walks. Don't reimplement key-prompts/MCP-writes/permission-grants here — keep configure-skills as the single source of truth so standalone use and inline use behave identically.
- **No `.claude/skills/` creation in Step 7.** That directory is only needed for custom-authored skills (configure-skills Section B). Sandbox often denies it; let configure-skills create it lazily.
- **URL fetches are best-effort.** Don't loop retries; note failures and move on. Don't ask the user to confirm the synthesised facts — let them edit later.
